# Transfer-Old-Time-Clock-Submissions
This script was written in Apps Script for an internship. The purpose is to store the previous' month's time clock submissions in a new Google Spreadsheet at the start of each month. This helps keep the main Spreadsheet less cluttered. This script is also connected with a monthly trigger in the Apps Script project.
